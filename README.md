This repository contains the publicly shareable C# gameplay scripts from "Have You Seen This Cat?", a Unity game developed by Chunked.
All scripts were solely developed by Heron Lin (Croyangi).

This repo is meant for:
- recruiters
- collaborators
- anyone reviewing my code structure, architecture, and scripting approach

Only the Assets/_Scripts directory is included.
All proprietary assets, purchased packages, and Unity-specific content are intentionally excluded.
